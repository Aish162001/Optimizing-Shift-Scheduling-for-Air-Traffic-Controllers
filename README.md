# Optimizing-Shift-Scheduling-for-Air-Traffic-Controllers
This project aims to tackle the problem of shift scheduling for controllers by integrating a
multimodal approach that combines traditional scheduling techniques with emotion
recognition models. The idea is to use audio and video data to assess the emotional state of
controllers and adjust their schedules accordingly, ensuring that individuals who may be
emotionally distressed or fatigued are either reassigned or given sufficient rest.
